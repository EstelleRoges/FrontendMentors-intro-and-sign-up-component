## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Sass
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I already knew this before, but it's the second time i use CSS variables in a project. This is kind of revolutionnary to me; I recommend to try that! 

### Continued development

Coding logic in general is still a bit hard to ge through for me, sometimes...I have to train more on this!
